I'd like to thank a few people:

Kevin Anderson - For submitting patches,  and submitting iWar to the 
OpenBSD "ports".

Natas,  the _war dialing_ mang for testing and ideas (binrev.com and 
oldskoolphreak.com fame!).

m2mike,  off binrev.com for some cool ideas about how to improve this
software.

gid,  for the "soon to be released" improved iWar website.

Big prop's to JFalcon for Cygwin build information and additional ideas
for this dialer. 

Dominatus - Bug reports,  and ideas..  

BlackRatchet,  and all of the binrev.com crew. 

Of course,  the entire Telephreak crew!
