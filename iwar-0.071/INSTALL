Basic Installation:
-------------------

	Installing and compiling should be pretty straight forward. 
At the command prompt,  type:

$ ./configure
$ make

	"make install" as "root" will install the iWar binary in the 
/usr/local/bin.   iWar configuration files are stored in the /usr/local/etc.
If these locations don't suit you,   use the --prefix option to change
this:  For example:

 $ ./configure --prefix=/some/path

 	If you are interested in installing iWar with IAX2 support, 
please see the README.IAX2 for more information! 

 	If you do _not_ want MySQL support,  run configure like this:

$ ./configure --disable-mysql

	To disable VoIP/IAX2 support, type:

$ ./configure --disable-iax2

	Of course,  you can add those flags together to disable both
IAX2 and MySQL:

$ ./configure --disable-iax2 --disable-mysql

Installation with MySQL support:
--------------------------------

	If you want to store war dialing information within a MySQL database,
make sure libmysqlclient and the mysql headers are installed.    The
"./configure" checks for this automatically.   Look carefully through 
the output. 

	Once iWar is built with MySQL support,  you'll need to create
the database.   There is a database schema with in the iwar/schema 
directory.   MySQL authentication information is stored in the iwar.conf.
To create the iWar MySQL database,  do the following:

$ mysqladmin -u root -p create iwar

	Then we create the tables... (from the schema file in the schema 
directory)

$ mysql -u root -p iwar < mysql-iwar

	After the database and tables are setup,  you'll need to setup a 
username/password for iWar to use.

$ mysql -u root -p iwar
  (at the MySQL command prompt)

grant insert,select on iwar.* to iwar@localhost identified 'somepassword' 

	You can substitute "insert,select" with "all" if you want the iWar
user to have "all" rights.  Once you've setup the MySQL database,  you
can use the -m flag to log information to it.
