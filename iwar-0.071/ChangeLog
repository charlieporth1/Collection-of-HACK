[01/16/2006] - 0.071 Release, "Now with 101% more VoIP" - Beave
 
               Fixed problem with MySQL logging.   MySQL logging was broken
	       with the 0.07 release.

	       Fixed problem with "custom" keystroke marking.  It wasn't 
	       saving the data.   It also wasn't inserting the data into
	       the database correctly.

	       Fixed a "hang" problem during IAX2 mode when a MySQL error
	       happened. 

	       Changed callerid handling a bit.   Do _not_ run if the 
	       user sets the caller ID to "911".  Also,  if 
	       iax2_callerid_number is not set,  we set it to 5551212.

	       In "full logging" mode,  iWar didn't log timeouts.  Fixed.

	       Added more user submitted banners!


[01/14/2006] - 0.07 Released, "Now with 100% more VoIP!"  - |337Jesus 

               Added support for IAX2.   You can now wardial via the IAX2
	       protocol!  iWar is a full blown IAX2 client!

	       Added sending DTMF tones when using IAX2 mode. (0-9, *, #)

	       Fixed small bugs with command line arg's (output file)

	       The default is no longer DTR hangups,  but plughangup()
	       (+++ATH).  This is pretty generic and supported by everything.
	       If you _can_ use DTR drops,  then use it.  Typically, 
	       Linux supports DTR drops great,  while BSD's don't (probably
	       my fault? ).

	       Fixed problem with changing the volume during dialing. 
	       (iWar would hang up sending a ASCII 13,   but the 
	       modemqueue wouldn't be processed).

	       Fixed major problem with "saving state".  When scanning, 
	       then saving,  then loading,  and saving again,   it would
	       mangle the savestate file.

	       Fixed bug in key stroke marking.  This could cause screwy
	       hangups,  and was also slowing down keyboard response time!
	       This was a issue brought to my attention several times.
               
	       Included patch (snprint/strncpy) from Kevin Anderson.  I made
	       some minor changes,  as his patch used OpenBSD strlcpy/
	       strlcat (changed to strncpy/strncat). 

	       Added "dtrsec" option.   This allows the user to set the
	       amount of time during a DTR drop (might make hanging up
	       work better on some modems).

	       Fixed up the plushangup function to work correctly.  If your
	       modem doesnt support DTR drops,  it should be safe to use
	       the plushangup. 

	       Fixed multiple FreeBSD issues (probably fixed other BSDs).

	       Made the configure.in a little more robust.   For example,
	       added --disable-iax2 and --disable-mysql in the 
	       go ole "./configure" flags. 

	       Fixed strftime() warnings.   These actually lead to seg.
	       faults on the AMD64.  All fixed!

	       More code cleanup.

[12/01/2005] - 0.06 Released, "Protovision,  I have you now...."

               Made the screen redraw (when resizing the screen) into the
	       function - drawinfo()

	       Added more banners!  Thanks to m2mike on binrev.com.
	       If you've got a banner, send it my way!

	       Added "dtrinit" option.  Some modems (USR Couiers) treat DTR
	       hangups like sending a "ATZ".  You can probably disable
	       this in the modem firmware.   With this enabled,  after
	       a hangup/skip/comment/connect,  after DTR drops the
	       modem will be re-initialized. 

	       Added a new terminal window at the bottom of the screen.
	       This allows you to watch iWar as it works.  If it connects
	       to a remote system,  the data will be displayed there. 
	       (Ends up being a nice feature to help debug problems
	       to!).

	       Fixed issue with "Screen full,  Clearing...." (Didn't
	       clear the entire screen all the time).

	       Fixed major problem with "Toneloc" style tone location.  
	       Modem init's and such would cause for a false positive
	       "FOUND TONE!".   It's now set to ignore init string's.
	       Also,  modem did not hang up after tone detection.  This
	       is now done during tone scanning (Toneloc style) by 
	       sending a ATH0.   Since this is the case,  you can't
	       have "dtrinit" and "tone_detection" enabled in the 
	       iwar.conf.  When iWar starts,  it automatically detects
	       if both are set,  and adjusts.   dtrinit isn't needed
	       during tone location as we are sending a ATH0 and not
	       dropping DTR. 

	       Modified the INIT string to support S06 and S07. 
	       This has worked all along,  just DTR on USR's screws
	       it up (hence the dtrinit option in the iwar.conf).

	       Added "TONE" detection.  I have never seen a modem that
	       responds this way, but I've been told they exist.  Might
	       as well support it.  (If you know what type of modem supports
	       this,  please let me know.  I've been told older USR
	       Couriers do this).

	       Fixed a minor issue with seq/random scanning in that it would
	       always miss the last number.  Easy fix.

	       Fixed a major issue where Seq. scanning and loading
	       from a state file would result in incomplete scan.  It
	       didnt verify that the number had already been dialed in the
	       past correctly.

	       Fixed a similar, but seperate issue with random scanning
	       and loading states.  When scanning random,  would result
	       in incomplete scans,  and would also dial the same numbers
	       multiple times.  

	       Fixed problem when saving state that cause the previous
	       filename to be concatenated to current ( pointed out by
	       dominatus on binrev.com)

	       Fixed small problem with screen clearing. 

	       Marking numbers took a bit of time.   At the request of
	       dominatus,  I speed this up a bit. 

	       Added a "ring_timeout" option.  Rather than wait for serial
	       timeout (which might cause you to miss something),  you 
	       can set a timeout between rings.   For example,  if you
	       get two rings,  and not another ring for X number of seconds
	       then something answered,  but modem never returned a result
	       code.

	       Made it easy to get out of "Save state" prompts.   So, 
	       if you hit "s" or "q" by mistake,  you can just hit enter
	       and resume scanning.

	       Added a simple but nifty AGI (Asterisk) tool and recording
	       for testing iWar without actually making a call.  Look in
	       the "iwar-asterisk-testing".  Read the README.

[11/18/2005] - 0.05 Released, "Phone Sex Goddess Jane Barbe (RIP)".

               Change #include <time.h> to <sys/time.h>. 

               Fixed goof up in configuration file.  I had at the top (port
	       settings) "port=/dev/ttyS0", which won't work!  It should
	       be "port /dev/ttyS0".

	       Slight issue with the banners.txt.  Stray \n.

               Fixed strtok() problems that where causing seg. faults
               under Cygwin.   This also fixes MacOS X builds (thanks
	       nyquist for the build help!).

               Some cosmetic code cleanup.  (stupid strcmp statements).
	       
	       Seperated the -b (banner detection disabled) and the -o
               (disabled banner recording).  This way,  you can do just a
               -b to disabled banner detection,  but leave recording enabled.
               or -o -b which will not record the banner,  and not attempt
               to detect the banner type (hang up after connection).

	       Built a static linked Windows CYGWIN version of iwar which
               is _NOT_ included in this archive.   For the *nix disabled.

[11/16/2005] - 0.04 Released, "Drop the modem and nobody gets hurt!" (Skram, 
               on IRC). 

	       Cosmetic fix.  Banner detection enabled displayed
               "CONNECT",  disabled banner detection displayed "CONNECTED".

	       Added recording of the remote banner when a carrier is 
	       found (-o,  enabled by default).   iWar will record any
               information received from the remote system.   If -o
               is set,  it'll attempt to identify the remote system, 
               but will not record it.  -b (disable banner detection)
               will disable remote logging and banner detection (just
               records the "CONNECT".. nothing more.

	       Added a bit of a exit screen.

               Since -o was added,  had to change the MySQL schema.  Now
               has a TEXT field for remote system response storage. 

               Change some of the defaults in iwar.conf. 

	       Added a few more examples in the README file. 

	       Minor changes to configure.in to grab system type.  

	       Fixed small problem compiling without MySQL support. 

[11/14/2005] - 0.03 Release.  "Natas's Complete Life - Part 2!"

	       When loading pre-generated number,  the software sort goofed
	       up the display and log file output.  This has been fixed.

	       Fixed some other small dialer bug/problems (NO CARRIER's
	       still screwing up things).  Should be resolved now. (I hope).

	       Fixed problem with remote_ring and serial timeout.  Seems
	       that if remote_ring was set to "0",  you'd get a "max.
	       ring count received" upon hangup.   Serial timeout's would
	       cause a NO CARRIER.   To fix both,  I no longer send
	       \r\r,  but drop DTR,  clear the buffer and call nplot
	       (rather than rely on the NO CARRIER part).

	       Fixed problem with "remote_ring".   "remote_ring" should
	       tell the system to hang up.

	       Fixed a problem with modem volume change/skip number
	       combo.   That is,  if you told iWar to change the volume
	       on the next pass,  then skipped the number (via spacebar), 
	       It would get caught in a loop of "NO CARRIER"'s.  
	
	       Made the iwar.conf init string a bit more generic.  Seems
	       that ATS7=255 screws up some modems. 

	       There was a problem when loading a pre-saved state file that
	       the counts/display would get outta wack.  The "count"
	       (numbers left to dial) wouldn't be correct with the actual
	       numbers left to dial.   This is fixed.  It shows total
	       numbers now (start - end) then "skips" (and subtracts)
	       when it encounters a already dialed number.

	       Problem when saving the current state of a dial.  I had 
               intended to 'append' to the state file,  but then decided
               to over write it.   I never took out the "check if we've
               loaded from a state file - if so,  just append the new
               dialed numbers" crap.   That's been removed.  Save state
               now works much better. 

[11/13/2005] - 0.02 Released.  "Natas's Complete Life!"

               Made spacebar skip number (Request from m2mike on
               the binrev.com forums).  Move "Mark" (that was spacebar)
               to the letter 'm'.  Made note of this in README (Keys).

               Sometimes "NO CARRIER's" would cause the iWar to "skip" a
               number.   Fixed this issue.  (Noticed by Da Beave)

               Changed the "blacklist" structure array.  T'was semi-silly.
               (Noticed By Da Beave)

               Added a '-L' option at the request of Natas.  This allows you
               to create a pre-generated list of numbers to dial/check.
               For example,  you could write a perl routine to generate
               a list of numbers that hit every area code and dial
               "8675309".   I'm sure other people have better ideas for
               this function :)

               ("That would be AWESOME! It would make my life complete!").

[11/13/2005] - 0.01 Released.  "Da Spawn".
