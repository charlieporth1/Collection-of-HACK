	This "iwar-test.agi" is a simple AGI (Asterisk Gateway Interface)
that allows me to test iWar for bugs.   Rather than test iWar by making
real calls out on the PSTN,  this AGI simply "acts" like the call is 
being placed on the PSTN by a set of recordings.  

	With this setup,  you can "tweak" your VoIP/Asterisk setup without
ever actually making a call :)

        This _requires_ that you have a modem,  a VoIP ATA/PAP2 device
that connects to a Asterisk server!

        The AGI is very, very simple.  

Installation:
-------------

1.  Copy all the sound files to the Asterisk sound directory (as root).

# cp *.wav /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/

2.  Copy "iwar-test.agi" to the Asterisk AGI directory.

# cp iwar-test.agi /var/lib//var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/

3.  Make sure "iwar-test.agi" is executable. 

# chmod 755 /var/lib//var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin/iwar-test.agi

4.  Add the following line into your /etc/extensions.conf dial plan (or
    something similar).

exten => _919555.,1,agi,iwar-test.agi

5.  Reload Asterisk.


What does this do?
------------------

	When you're modem picks up (on the ATA) and dials anything like
9195551000,   that AGI will handle the call.   You can now test iWar
with a range like thus:

# iwar -e 919 -r 5551000-5552000
