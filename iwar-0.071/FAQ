Q.	How come when I put in a range of -r 9045551212-9045551313,  I
	get "ERROR: Largest random number is 2147483647.  Try using the 
	predial string"?

A.	RAND_MAX determines the largest random number your system will
	support.   Rather than trying to put the static NPA (904 in this
	case),  use something like:

	iwar -e 904 -r 5551212-5551313

	If for some reason you _must_ use "9045551212" (for example), 
	you can do it sequentially (the -x flag).  

Q.	I wanted to scan for faxes and I have a fax capible modem.
	Why won't iWar detect them?

A.	Most modems will only do data or fax,  not both.  

Q.	I want to use iWar in IAX2 mode,   how do compile support in for
	this?  

A.	Read the README.IAX2 file.
