# Modem INIT string.  This can vary for modem manufactures.  Check your
# modems manual for the best settings.   Below is a very _basic_ init
# string.  The main thing to make things work better is DTR hangups and
# dial speed.   Here's what is set in this string.
#
# E1   =  Echo on
# L3   =  Modem speaker on high.
# M1   =  Modem speaker on until carrier detect
# Q0   =  Result codes sent
# &C1  =  Modem controls carrier detect
# &D2  =  DTE controls DTR (for DTR hangup!)
# S11  =  50 millisecond DTMF tones.   On the PSTN in my area,  45ms DTMF 
#         works fine,  and it might for you.  It's set to 50ms to be safe.
#         My ATA's can handle 40ms DTMF,  which is as fast as the modem
#	  can product.  If you're having dial problems,  slow down this
#         setting by increasing it.  For faster dialing,  decrease this.
# S06  =  How long to "wait" for a dial tone.   Modems normally set this
#         to 2 seconds or so.   This is terrible if you're trying to 
#         detect tones!  This is for Toneloc type tone location 
#         (ATDT5551212W;).  You may need to adjust this.
# S07  =  Wait 255 seconds for something to happen.   We set it high because 
#         we want iWar to decide when to hangup. See "serial_timeout". 
# 
# Extra things to add to the init string:
#
# +FCLASS=1  = Want to scan for fax machines (And only fax - however, 
#              the Zylex modems might do data/fax)
#
# X4         = All modems support this.  If you add "X4" to the init string,
#              your modem will detect "NO DIALTONE",  and "BUSY".
# X6 or X7   = Certain modems (USR Couriers,  for example) can detect remote
#              call progression.  X7 is good because it leaves everything 
#              on (RINGING,  BUSY,  NO CARRIER) except "VOICE".  "VOICE"
#              is sometimes triggered by interesting tones.   X6 leaves
#              everything on.   This is good when your doing carrier
#              detection!
# X0         = Set modem to blind dialing.  This is good if you're into 
#              "hand scanning".  The modem doesn't attempt to detect
#              anything like BUSY or VOICE (it will still detect carriers).
#              You can then use the manual keys to mark numbers.

init ATE1L3M1Q0&C1&D2S11=50S07=255

# If your modem is not capable of doing DTR hangups,   then leave this 
# enabled.  This hangs up the modem by sending the old "+++ATH" to  the 
# modem on connections.  If your _positive_ your modem is using  DTR drops to 
# hang up,  you can save scan time by setting this to disabling this.   
# If you enable this and DTR drops don't work,  your line will NOT hang up 
# on carrier detection!

# This only applies to modems that support remote call progression
# (For example, "RINGING").   Modems that can do this are the USR
# Couriers,  Multitech and Zyxel modems.    If your modem doesn't 
# support this,  ignore this.

# remote_ring 5

# If remote ring is enabled and functional,  then this is the max time
# we'll allow between rings with no result code (BUSY,  CONNECT, 
# VOICE).   For example.   If we receive two RINGING result codes,  
# but 30 seconds see nothing else,   then something picked up on the
# remote side the modem didn't register.   It might be worth going back
# and checking. 

# ring_timeout 20

# This is for modems that reliably detect remote "tones".  This changes
# the dial string from the standard "ATDT5551212" to "ATDT5551212w;"
# (See about about the ATS06=255 - wait for dial tone).  When the modem
# dials,  it "waits" for another tone.  If the iWar receives a "OK"
# then we know that end supplied some sort of tone.  Most modems can't
# do this.  Leave this commented out if your modem doesnt support it.

# tone_detect 1

# Banner file.   Banners are used to attempt to figure out what the remote
# system is.

banner_file /usr/local/etc/banners.txt

# Blacklist file.  This file contains phone number that should never be called

# Serial connection timeout (in seconds).    This is used to detect when 
# the modem doesn't return a result code.   In that event,  we'll 
# hang the modem up.  See the ATS07 (S07) at the top of this config file.

serial_timeout 60

# When connected (carrier detected),  this is the amount of time to wait (in
# seconds) for iWar to search for a  "login banner".   If no data is received 
# and/or there is no banner,   we hang up when this amount of time is reached.

banner_timeout 20

# On the off chance that we keep receiving data,  and the banner_timeout is
# never reached,  this is the amount of data we will receive before giving
# up (hang up).   Data sent from the remote end resets the banner_timeout -
# without this safe guard,  the system may never hangup because it keeps
# receiving data!.   Value is in bytes.

banner_maxcount 2048

# After connecting,  this is how long we wait (in seconds) to send a 
# return.  Some system won't reveal there banners until they 
# receive several \r\r's.    Value is in seconds.

banner_send_cr 10

# This is the number a carriage returns to send once banner_send_cr is reached.

banner_cr 3

# After connecting,  wait this long until picking up and trying to medial out.
# Measured in seconds.

connect_re-dial 5 

# How long to wait before re-dialing after a BUSY, NO CARRIER,  etc event.
# in seconds.  On PSTN environments,   you need to wait a few seconds before
# dialing the next number (or it'll register as a "flash").   On VoIP
# hardware based scans,  you can probably lower this to decrease scan time.
# This does not affect IAX2 dialing.

redial 3

# DTR re-init.  Some modems (USR Couriers) when DTR is dropped,  you have
# to re-init the modem (I assume the USR treats DTR drops like ATZ). 
# This will re-init after DTR drops.   

# dtrinit 1

# Amount of time to drop DTR.   Some modems require longer DTR drops to 
# hang up.   Value is in seconds.   (If possible,  0 is best!).
