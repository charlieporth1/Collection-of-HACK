o  BREAK UP THE LAYOUT.  For example, make iwar-loginfo.c and move the stupid
   MySQL/Log functions there.
o  Postgres support - natas binrev.
o  Re-write/fix up the damn README...  I don't like it. - Beave
o  Add support for external sounds. Basically, make execl calls to things
   like mpg321 to play a file when a carrier is found. - Beave
o  Daemon mode - that might be nice.  - Beave
o  Screen redrawing needs to be handled better - Beave



More "Maybe we'll do this" TODO
-------------------------------
o  Ability to read THC-Scan and TONELOC files? (m2mike - binrev)
o  Add a basic "terminal modem" window so you can call all the
   carriers detected. (jfalcon - IRC).  (Sorta done,  added a
   terminal window down at the bottm,  but this isn't exactly
   what jfalcon meant).
o  Added a net lookup for numbers (for example,  have iWar hit up things
   like dslbroker for example,  to reverse lookup - if possible) - Jfalcon
